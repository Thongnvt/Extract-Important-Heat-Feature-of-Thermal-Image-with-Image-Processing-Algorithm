# Extract-Important-Heat-Feature-of-Thermal-Image-with-Image-Processing-Algorithm

Hi, welcome to my github, my name is Thong, but you can call me Brian. 

In this branch, only contain readme file, this will help you to have a quick view about the algorithm, the idea is very simple. The only hard thing I do in this code is combine them together and make it work. You can find the code in main branch. 

I think i will comeback tomorrow to introduce the algortihm, I have an appointment right now. ("wink")
