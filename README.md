# Extract-Important-Heat-Feature-of-Thermal-Image-with-Image-Processing-Algorithm

Hi, welcome to my github, my name is Thong, but you can call me Brian. 

This is an algorithm that I developed myself, aimed at enhancing the ability to learn and distinguish the thermal features in thermal images. It is applied to the task of detecting individuals consuming alcoholic beverages using the DL model ResNet50.

The paper was accepted by AIAAP-cosit 2025. And now me and my team currently submit this to IWSSIP 2025 conferrence (North Macedonia).

Hi, welcome to my github, my name is Thong, but you can call me Brian. 

In this branch, only contain readme file, this will help you to have a quick view about the algorithm, the idea is very simple. The only hard thing I do in this code is combine them together and make it work. You can find the code in main branch. Also the paper of my team project.

I think i will comeback tomorrow to introduce the algortihm, I have an appointment right now. ("wink")
