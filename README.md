#  Extract Important Heat Features from Thermal Images

This project applies image processing algorithms to thermal images in order to extract and highlight important heat-related features.

##  Features

- Load and display thermal images
- Apply filters and enhancement techniques
- Segment heat-intensive areas
- Export processed results


## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Thongnvt/Extract-Important-Heat-Feature-of-Thermal-Image-with-Image-Processing-Algorithm.git
cd Extract-Important-Heat-Feature-of-Thermal-Image-with-Image-Processing-Algorithm

### 2. Install requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Run the project

There are 2 ways to run the project 
+ If you want to run a whole folder -> Run : " python batch_processing_gui.py"
+ And if you just want to test on single picture -> Run: "python compare.py"

### Algorithms Used
+ CLAHE 
+ Multiscale Top Hat Transform 
+ Multiscale Guided Filtering 
+ Regional Specific Enhancement
